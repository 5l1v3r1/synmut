Dear Dr. Hahn,

please find enclosed the revision of our manuscript "Quantifying
selection against synonymous mutations in HIV-1 env evolution". To
address the concerns of referee 2, we have performed additional
extensive simulations of our model that confirm our previous estimates
of the average deleterious effect of synonymous mutations. We have also
implemented the Latin hyper-cube sampling scheme the referee suggested
and now sample a much larger parameter space. In addition, we have added
discussions of the burstiness of HIV-1 evolution and a discussion of the
plausible parameter ranges. We include a point-by-point response to each
of the reviewer's comments. 

We would like to thank you and the reviewers for this very constructive
review that has helped to improve the manuscript. 

Sincerely,

Richard Neher
