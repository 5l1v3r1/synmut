This manuscript examines synonymous mutations in the HIV-1 Envelope gene. The
data are taken from other publications and this is a modelling manuscript. I am
not able to judge the mathematical modelling critically but can comment on the
potential importance of the conclusions.

The text is clearly written and the written arguments are well spelled out.
They observe that synonymous mutations in the C2-V5 region that disrupt
modelled base pairs in SHAPE assays are more likely to be lost than other
mutations, implying clear fitness costs to the virus, although they point out
that those with major costs will never reach high frequencies. They argue that
less deleterious mutations, but still with a fitness cost, can rise to high
frequency by 'hitch hiking' with immune selected non-synonymous mutations, in
other words simple linkage. The selection against synonymous slows down
evolution of the virus so selective forces may have been underestimated in the
past. These are important concepts and show that immune escape mutations
should not be considered in isolation. They support the view that 'landscaping'
approaches such as that described recently by Chakraborty in Immunity (Immunity
38:606-617, 2013), need to be applied. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Fabio: The Chakraborty paper is a maximum-likelihood fit of database frequencies
       and 2-point correlations of untreated patients. What exactly this has to do
       with our manuscript, I am not sure. I suppose we could add a citation if
       that's the suggestion.

The manuscript "Quantifying selection against synonymous mutations in HIV-1 env
evolution" by Zanini and Neher analyzes intra-patient HIV data and finds that
most synonymous mutation in the RNA stems flanking the variable loops of gp120
are at a selective disadvantage in vivo, with a small selection coefficient of
the order of -0.002. They also point to the importance of draft instead of
drift in the intrapatient evolution of HIV.

These are interesting results and the manuscript is clearly written. The second
observation is not novel, but underappreciated, whereas this is the first
concrete calculation of the average selective disadvantage of silent mutations
in HIV taking draft into account. As such, it is necessary for this work to
establish proper error estimates so that the community can make valid use of
the results.  With this in mind, the manuscript can be strengthened in the
following respects:

##############################################################################
1) The modeling generation time of 1 day is odd.  It takes about a day for the
virion to integrate and start transcription.  One usually takes 2 days as the
mean generation time, but there is individual variation. See next point.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Fabio: This is only a scaling factor that limits our accuracy indeed. We should
       stress this point more.

##############################################################################
2) Related to the above: the simulation does not address how sensitive the
results are to varying the parameters (in particular, the generation time, the
outcrossing rate, the mutation rate, and the assigned deleterious fitness of
the "non-synonymous" changes).  In the absence of described theoretical
analysis shaping our expectations, I strongly feel that this sensitivity
analysis needs to be part of the results, and folded into the error bars.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Fabio:
- generation time is only a scaling factor
- mutation rate play no big role, as we look for times and fates of
  high-frequencies alleles anyway
- outcrossing rate sets the time scale for the decay of linkage, so it is a
  crucial parameter. We should run simulations again at different coinfection
  rates for the supplementary.
- the scatter plot is not gated by nonsynonymous observables, so it gives an
  impression of the range of selection coefficients on synonymous mutations given
  by different nonsynonymous parameters (a factor of ~3 or so). Since we have
  little idea about the dynamics of nonsynonymous changes anyway, reducing this
  errorbar is harder.

##############################################################################
3) The reasonableness of the ranges for the various parameters should be argued
with citation to existing literature.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Fabio: This is there already, maybe we should be more explicit in the methods
       (e.g. generation time)

##############################################################################
4) I am a bit surprised that the authors chose to do random sampling in their
multidimensional parameter space.  One would have expected a Latin hypercube
sampling to provide a better coverage.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Fabio: We could do more fancy stuff as Latin hypercube, but I do not think it is
       needed: our coverage is excellent. It is only a matter of showing the prior
       I think. I added the figure 'simulations_syn_flat.pdf' in the 'figures'
       folder to show that the space is well covered.

##############################################################################
5) The actual dynamics of HIV in the body is presumably more complex: it is
likely that the virions are produced in large bursts of virtually genetically
identical virions most of which are then cleared by the body fast on the
time-scale of HIV generations. There is no discussion whether this leads to
increased stochasticity in the dynamics, nor whether this can influence the
quantitative evaluations presented here. It is possible that the authors mean
to absorb these into some kind of reduced effective population size, but a
short discussion would be beneficial.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Fabio : fair enough, we do not discuss population sizes in here. Since we do not
        look at rare variants, the exact propagation mechanism is irrelevant: if
        mutants are generated continuously and N >> mu/|s_d| = 100 so that high
        frequency is only reached by draft, N should not make a huge difference.
        We should discuss this point more thoroughly.

##############################################################################
6) In the discussions, the rise of synonymous mutations is attributed to draft,
but the fall to selective effects. In general, some of the fall might also be
due to overlapping selective sweeps: the manuscript does not discuss this
possibility.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Fabio: Maybe we just need some more discussion here. If HIV were asexual, that
       would be the case (clonal interf). Recombination breaks linkage so this should
       happen only rarely in HIV. In addition, clonal interference would not generate
       a correlation with RNA structure.  Finally, simulations with realistic
       recombination rates show that only deleterious synonymous mutations can lower
       P_fix(syn), even in the case of 6 escape mutations per epitope (perfect
       incompatibility).

##############################################################################
7) The observed neutral fixation pattern of the nonsynonymous mutations is
mentioned, and two explanations have been proposed to duet of increased
diversity over synonymous mutations with no increase of fixation over neutral
expectations.  Neither of the explanations, however, are plausible (at least,
without argument) absent experimental evidence not mentioned in the text. It
would perhaps be better to either strengthen this discussion with citation to
literature, or to weaken it by mentioning these as mere possibilities amongst
others.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Fabio: we could cite more literature. I do not see what the other possibilities
       could be.
