	abstract = {{HIV} adaptation to a host in chronic infection is simulated by means of a Monte-Carlo algorithm that includes the evolutionary factors of mutation, positive selection with varying strength among sites, random genetic drift, linkage, and recombination. By comparing two sensitive measures of linkage disequilibrium {(LD)} and the number of diverse sites measured in simulation to patient data from one-time samples of pol gene obtained by single-genome sequencing from representative untreated patients, we estimate the effective recombination rate and the average selection coefficient to be on the order of 1\% per genome per generation (10(-5) per base per generation) and 0.5\%, respectively. The adaptation rate is twofold higher and fourfold lower than predicted in the absence of recombination and in the limit of very frequent recombination, respectively. The level of {LD} and the number of diverse sites observed in data also range between the values predicted in simulation for these two limiting cases. These results demonstrate the critical importance of finite population size, linkage, and recombination in {HIV} evolution.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics of {HIV} during the chronic phase of infection is driven by the host immune response and by selective pressures exerted through drug treatment. To understand and model the evolution of {HIV} quantitatively, the parameters governing genetic diversification and the strength of selection need to be known. While mutation rates can be measured in single replication cycles, the relevant effective recombination rate depends on the probability of coinfection of a cell with more than one virus and can only be inferred from population data. However, most population genetic estimators for recombination rates assume absence of selection and are hence of limited applicability to {HIV}, since positive and purifying selection are important in {HIV} evolution. Yet, little is known about the distribution of selection differentials between individual viruses and the impact of single polymorphisms on viral fitness. Here, we estimate the rate of recombination and the distribution of selection coefficients from time series sequence data tracking the evolution of {HIV} within single patients. By examining temporal changes in the genetic composition of the population, we estimate the effective recombination to be rho = 1.4+/-0.6 x 10(-5) recombinations per site and generation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the selection coefficients of at least 15\% of the observed non-synonymous polymorphisms exceed 0.8\% per generation. These results provide a basis for a more detailed understanding of the evolution of {HIV.} A particularly interesting case is evolution in response to drug treatment, where recombination can facilitate the rapid acquisition of multiple resistance mutations. With the methods developed here, more precise and more detailed studies will be possible as soon as data with higher time resolution and greater sample sizes are available.},

Viral replication is regulated at many levels, including the use of conserved genomic {RNA} structures. Most potential regulatory elements in viral {RNA} genomes are uncharacterized. Here we report the structure of an entire {HIV-1} genome at single nucleotide resolution using {SHAPE}, a high-throughput {RNA} analysis technology. The genome encodes protein structure at two levels. In addition to the correspondence between {RNA} and protein primary sequences, a correlation exists between high levels of {RNA} structure and sequences that encode inter-domain loops in {HIV} proteins. This correlation suggests that {RNA} structure modulates ribosome elongation to promote native protein folding. Some simple genome elements previously shown to be important, including the ribosomal gag-pol frameshift stem-loop, are components of larger {RNA} motifs. We also identify organizational principles for unstructured {RNA} regions, including splice site acceptors and hypervariable regions. These results emphasize that the {HIV-1} genome and, potentially, many coding {RNAs} are punctuated by previously unrecognized regulatory motifs and that extensive {RNA} structure constitutes an important component of the genetic code.},

Although gag codon optimization is widely used in {DNA} vectors and experimental vaccines, the actual effect of altered codon usage on gag translational efficiency has not been {quantified.Methodology} and Principal {FindingsTo} quantify translational efficiency of gag {mRNA} in live T cells, we transfected Jurkat cells with increasing doses of capped, polyadenylated synthetic {mRNA} corresponding to wildtype or codon-optimized gag sequences, measured Gag production by quantitative {ELISA} and flow cytometry, and estimated the translational efficiency of each transcript as pg of Gag antigen produced per Âµg of input {mRNA.} We found that codon optimization yielded a small increase in gag translational efficiency (approximately 1.6 fold). In contrast when cells were transfected with {DNA} vectors requiring nuclear transcription and processing of gag {mRNA}, codon optimization resulted in a very large enhancement of Gag {production.ConclusionsWe} conclude that suboptimal codon usage by {HIV-1} results in only a slight loss of gag translational efficiency per se, with the vast majority of enhancement in protein expression from {DNA} vectors due to altered processing and export of nuclear {RNA.}},

We study codon usage as a discriminating signature of gene- and even residue-specific diversifying and purifying selection. Nonrandom codon choice can increase or decrease the effective local substitution rate. We demonstrate that the codons of hemagglutinin, particularly those in the antibody-combining regions, are significantly biased toward substitutional point mutations relative to the codons of other influenza virus genes. We discuss the evolutionary interpretation and implications of these biases for hemagglutinin's antigenic evolution. We also introduce information-theoretic methods that use sequence data to detect regions of recent positive selection and potential protein conformational changes.},

Herein, we report the results of a survey of codon usage bias in a wide range of genetically and ecologically diverse human {RNA} viruses. This analysis showed that the overall extent of codon usage bias in {RNA} viruses is low and that there is little variation in bias between genes. Furthermore, the strong correlation between base and dinucleotide composition and codon usage bias suggested that mutation pressure rather than natural (translational) selection is the most important determinant of the codon bias observed. However, we also detected correlations between codon usage bias and some characteristics of viral genome structure and ecology, with increased bias in segmented and aerosol-transmitted viruses and decreased bias in vector-borne viruses. This suggests that translational selection may also have some influence in shaping codon usage bias.},

	abstract = {The ability of human immunodeficiency virus {(HIV-1)} to persist and cause {AIDS} is dependent on its avoidance of antibody-mediated neutralization. The virus elicits abundant, envelope-directed antibodies that have little neutralization capacity. This lack of neutralization is paradoxical, given the functional conservation and exposure of receptor-binding sites on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein, which are larger than the typical antibody footprint and should therefore be accessible for antibody binding. Because gp120âreceptor interactions involve conformational reorganization, we measured the entropies of binding for 20 gp120-reactive antibodies. Here we show that recognition by receptor-binding-site antibodies induces conformational change. Correlation with neutralization potency and analysis of receptorâantibody thermodynamic cycles suggested a receptor-binding-site 'conformational masking' mechanism of neutralization escape. To understand how such an escape mechanism would be compatible with virusâreceptor interactions, we tested a soluble dodecameric receptor molecule and found that it neutralized primary {HIV-1} isolates with great potency, showing that simultaneous binding of viral envelope glycoproteins by multiple receptors creates sufficient avidity to compensate for such masking. Because this solution is available for cell-surface receptors but not for most antibodies, conformational masking enables {HIV-1} to maintain receptor binding and simultaneously to resist neutralization.},

	abstract = {The rate of progression of {HIV} disease may be substantially different among {HIV-infected} individuals. Following infection of the host with any virus, the delicate balance between virus replication and the immune response to the virus determines both the outcome of the infection, i.e. the persistence versus elimination of the virus, and the different rates of progression. During primary {HIV} infection, a burst of viremia occurs that disseminates virus to the lymphoid organs. A potent immune response ensues that substantially, but usually not completely, curtails virus replication. This inability of the immune system to completely eliminate the virus leads to establishment of chronic, persistent infection that over time leads to profound immunosuppression. The potential mechanisms of virus escape from an otherwise effective immune response have been investigated. Clonal deletion of {HIV-specific} cytotoxic T-cell clones and sequestration of virus-specific cytotoxic cells away from the major site of virus replication represent important mechanisms of virus escape from the immune response that favor persistence of {HIV.} Qualitative differences in the primary immune response to {HIV} (i.e. mobilization of a restricted versus broader T-cell receptor repertoire) are associated with different rates of disease progression. Therefore, the initial interaction between the virus and immune system of the host is critical for the subsequent clinical outcome.},

	abstract = {Using synthetic oligonucleotides, a gene encoding the {HIV-1} replication primer, {tRNALys},3, was constructed and placed downstream from a bacteriophage T7 promoter. In vitro transcription of this gene yielded a form of {tRNALys},3 which lacks the modified bases characteristic of the natural species and the 3â²-G-A-dinucieotide. Synthetic {tRNALys},3 annealed to a pbs- {HIV1} {RNA} template can prime {cDNA} synthesis catalysed by recombinant {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase. Trans-{DDP} crosslinking indicates that this synthetic {tRNA} is still capable of interacting with {HIV-1} {RT} via a 12-nucleotide portion encompassing the anticodon domain. Gel-mobility shift and competition analyses imply that the affinity of synthetic {tRNA} for {RT} is reduced. In contrast to earlier observations, synthetic {tRNA} is readily competed from {RT} by natural {tRNAPro.} The reduced affinity of synthetic {tRNALys},3 for {RT} is not appreciably affected by mutations in positions within the loop of the anticodon domain. These results would imply that the overall structure of the anticodon domain of {tRNALys},3 is an important factor in its recognition by {HIV-1} {RT.} In addition, modified bases within this, although not absolutely required, would appear to make a significant contribution to the enhanced stability of the ribonucleoprotein complex.},

	abstract = {The virion cores of the replication competent type 1 human immunodeficiency virus {(HIV-1)}, a retrovirus, contain and {RNA} genome associated with nucleocapsid {(NC)} and reverse transcriptase {(RT} p66/p51) molecules. In vitro reconstructions of these complexes with purified components show that {NC} is required for efficient annealing of the primer {tRNALys},3. In the absence of {NC}, {HIV-1} {RT} is unable to retrotranscribe the viral {RNA} template from the {tRNA} primer. We demonstrate that the {HIV-1} {RT} p66/p51 specifically binds to its cognate primer {tRNALys},3 even in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of other {tRNAs.} Cross-linking analysis of this interaction locates the contact site to a region within the heavily modified anti-codon domain of {tRNALys},3.},

	abstract = {The 5â²-untranslated leader region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 {(HIV-1)} {RNA} contains multiple signals that control distinct steps of the viral replication cycle such as transcription, reverse transcription, genomic {RNA} dimerization, splicing, and packaging. It is likely that fine tuned coordinated regulation of these functions is achieved through specific {RNA-protein} and {RNA-RNA} interactions. In a search for cis-acting elements important for the tertiary structure of the 5â²-untranslated region of {HIV-1} genomic {RNA}, we identified, by ladder selection experiments, a short stretch of nucleotides directly downstream of the {poly(A)} signal that interacts with a nucleotide sequence located in the matrix region. Confirmation of the sequence of the interacting sites was obtained by partial or complete inhibition of this interaction by antisense oligonucleotides and by nucleotide substitutions. In the wild type {RNA}, this long range interaction was intramolecular, since no intermolecular {RNA} association was detected by gel electrophoresis with an {RNA} mutated in the dimerization initiation site and containing both sequences involved in the tertiary interaction. Moreover, the functional importance of this interaction is supported by its conservation in all {HIV-1} isolates as well as in {HIV-2} and simian immunodeficiency virus. Our results raise the possibility that this long range {RNA-RNA} interaction might be involved in the full-length genomic {RNA} selection during packaging, repression of the 5â² polyadenylation signal, and/or splicing regulation.},
