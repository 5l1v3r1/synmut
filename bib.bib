title = {Dynamics of {HIV}-1 recombination in its natural target cells},
abstract = {Genetic recombination is believed to assist HIV-1 diversification and escape from host immunity and antiviral therapies, yet this process remains largely unexamined within the natural target-cell populations. We developed a method for measuring HIV-1 recombination directly that employs reporter viruses bearing functional enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) genes in which recombination produces a modified GFP gene and GFP fluorescence in the infected cells. These reporter viruses allow simultaneous quantification of the dynamics of HIV-1 infection, coinfection, and recombination in cell culture and in animal models by flow-cytometric analysis. Multiround infection assays revealed that productive cellular coinfection was subject to little functional inhibition. As a result, generation of recombinants proceeded according to the square of the infection rate during HIV-1 replication in T lymphocytes and within human thymic grafts in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-hu (Thy/Liv) mice. These results suggest that increases in viral load may confer a compounding risk of virus escape by means of recombinational diversification. A single round of replication in T lymphocytes in culture generated an average of nine recombination events per virus, and infection of macrophages led to approximately 30 crossover events, making HIV-1 up to an order of magnitude more recombinogenic than recognized previously and demonstrating that the infected cell exerts a profound influence on the frequency of recombination.},

	abstract = {We used ultra-deep sequencing to obtain tens of thousands of {HIV-1} sequences from regions targeted by {CD8+} T lymphocytes from longitudinal samples from three acutely infected subjects, and modeled viral evolution during the critical first weeks of infection. Previous studies suggested that a single virus established productive infection, but these conclusions were tempered because of limited sampling; now, we have greatly increased our confidence in this observation through modeling the observed earliest sample diversity based on vastly more extensive sampling. Conventional sequencing of {HIV-1} from acute/early infection has shown different patterns of escape at different epitopes; we investigated the earliest escapes in exquisite detail. Over 3–6 weeks, ultradeep sequencing revealed that the virus explored an extraordinary array of potential escape routes in the process of evading the earliest {CD8} T-lymphocyte responses – using 454 sequencing, we identified over 50 variant forms of each targeted epitope during early immune escape, while only 2–7 variants were detected in the same samples via conventional sequencing. In contrast to the diversity seen within epitopes, non-epitope regions, including the Envelope V3 region, which was sequenced as a control in each subject, displayed very low levels of variation. In early infection, in the regions sequenced, the consensus forms did not have a fitness advantage large enough to trigger reversion to consensus amino acids in the absence of immune pressure. In one subject, a genetic bottleneck was observed, with extensive diversity at the second time point narrowing to two dominant escape forms by the third time point, all within two months of infection. Traces of immune escape were observed in the earliest samples, suggesting that immune pressure is present and effective earlier than previously reported; quantifying the loss rate of the founder virus suggests a direct role for {CD8} T-lymphocyte responses in viral containment after peak viremia. Dramatic shifts in the frequencies of epitope variants during the first weeks of infection revealed a complex interplay between viral fitness and immune escape.},

	abstract = {Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) are a principal component of an effective human immune response to many pathogens, yet their role in {HIV-1} infection is unclear. To gain a better understanding of this role, we examined plasma from patients with acute {HIV} infection. Here we report the detection of autologous Nab as early as 52 days after detection of {HIV-specific} antibodies. The viral inhibitory activity of Nab resulted in complete replacement of neutralization-sensitive virus by successive populations of resistant virus. Escape virus contained mutations in the env gene that were unexpectedly sparse, did not map generally to known neutralization epitopes, and involved primarily changes in N-linked glycosylation. This pattern of escape, and the exceptional density of {HIV-1} envelope glycosylation generally, led us to postulate an evolving ‘glycan shield’ mechanism of neutralization escape whereby selected changes in glycan packing prevent Nab binding but not receptor binding. Direct support for this model was obtained by mutational substitution showing that Nab-selected alterations in glycosylation conferred escape from both autologous antibody and epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. The evolving glycan shield thus represents a new mechanism contributing to {HIV-1} persistence in the face of an evolving antibody repertoire.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryOne} of the greatest challenges facing treatment and vaccine development for human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV-1)} is the genetic diversity of the virus. One of the main factors contributing to {HIV-1} diversity is recombination between two genetically different viral {RNA} genomes that enter a cell in the same virion. Such heterozygous virions can only arise from cells that contain two or more genetically distinct {HIV-1} proviruses. Therefore, the amount of productive {HIV-1} recombination in infected individuals is dependent on the number of multiple infected cells and the genetic relationship of the proviruses they contain. In this work we use a recently developed assay, single-cell sequencing, to analyze the number and genetic makeup of {HIV-1} {DNA} molecules in single infected cells. We used this assay to analyze memory and naïve {CD4+} T cells from lymph node tissue and peripheral blood sampled from five chronically untreated {HIV-1} infected individuals. Our results revealed that {\textless}10\% of infected memory and naïve T-cells from either the lymph node tissue or peripheral blood are multiply infected, a number far below earlier estimates. In addition, we demonstrate a similar genetic composition of {HIV-1} in lymph node tissue, peripheral blood and plasma during untreated chronic {HIV-1} infection.},

	abstract = {Background 
 Ultra-deep pyrosequencing ({UDPS)} allows identification of rare {HIV-1} variants and minority drug resistance mutations, which are not detectable by standard sequencing. 
 
 
 Principal Findings 
 Here, {UDPS} was used to analyze the dynamics of {HIV-1} genetic variation in reverse transcriptase ({RT)} (amino acids 180–220) in six individuals consecutively sampled before, during and after failing {3TC} and {AZT} containing antiretroviral treatment. Optimized {UDPS} protocols and bioinformatic software were developed to generate, clean and analyze the data. The data cleaning strategy reduced the error rate of {UDPS} to an average of 0.05\%, which is lower than previously reported. Consequently, the cut-off for detection of resistance mutations was very low. A median of 16,016 (range 2,406–35,401) sequence reads were obtained per sample, which allowed detection and quantification of minority resistance mutations at amino acid position 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215 and 219 in {RT.} In four of five pre-treatment samples low levels (0.07–0.09\%) of the {M184I} mutation were observed. Other resistance mutations, except {T215A} and {T215I} were below the detection limit. During treatment failure, {M184V} replaced {M184I} and dominated the population in combination with {T215Y}, while wild-type variants were rarely detected. Resistant virus disappeared rapidly after treatment interruption and was undetectable as early as after 3 months. In most patients, drug resistant variants were replaced by wild-type variants identical to those present before treatment, suggesting rebound from latent reservoirs. 
 
 
 Conclusions 
 With this highly sensitive {UDPS} protocol preexisting drug resistance was infrequently observed; only {M184I}, {T215A} and {T215I} were detected at very low levels. Similarly, drug resistant variants in plasma quickly decreased to undetectable levels after treatment interruption. The study gives important insights into the dynamics of the {HIV-1} quasispecies and is of relevance for future research and clinical use of the {UDPS} technology.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in controlling HIV-1 infection is vital for vaccine design. However, it is difficult to assess the importance of CTLs in natural infection. Different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles are associated with different rates of progression to AIDS, indicating that CTLs play a protective role. Yet virus clearance rates following antiretroviral therapy are not impaired in individuals with advanced HIV disease, suggesting that weakening of the CTL response is not the major underlying cause of disease progression and that CTLs do not have an important protective role. Here we reconcile these apparently conflicting studies. We estimate the selection pressure exerted by CTL responses that drive the emergence of immune escape variants, thereby directly quantifying the efficiency of HIV-1-specific CTLs in vivo. We estimate that only 2% of productively infected CD4+ cell death is attributable to CTLs recognising a single epitope. We suggest that CTLs kill a large number of infected cells (about 10(7)) per day but are not responsible for the majority of infected cell death.},

	abstract = {Codon evolutionary models are widely used to infer the selection forces acting on a protein. The non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio (denoted by {Ka/Ks)} is used to infer specific positions that are under purifying or positive selection. Current evolutionary models usually assume that only the non-synonymous rates vary among sites while the synonymous substitution rates are constant. This assumption ignores the possibility of selection forces acting at the {DNA} or {mRNA} levels. Towards a more realistic description of sequence evolution, we present a model that accounts for among-site-variation of both synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates. Furthermore, we alleviate the widespread assumption that positions evolve independently of each other. Thus, possible sources of bias caused by random fluctuations in either the synonymous or non-synonymous rate estimations at a single site is removed. Our model is based on two hidden Markov models that operate on the spatial dimension: one describes the dependency between adjacent non-synonymous rates while the other describes the dependency between adjacent synonymous rates. The presented model is applied to study the selection pressure across the {HIV-1} genome. The new model better describes the evolution of all {HIV-1} genes, as compared to current codon models. Using both simulations and real data analyses, we illustrate that accounting for synonymous rate variability and dependency greatly increases the accuracy of {Ka/Ks} estimation and in particular of positively selected sites. Finally, we discuss the applicability of the developed model to infer the selection forces in regulatory and overlapping regions of the {HIV-1} genome.

The {RNA} genome of the lentivirus family of retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV)}, contains e.g. an above average percentage of adenine (A) nucleotides, while being extremely poor in cytosine (C). Such a deviant base composition has implications for the amino acids that are encoded by the open reading frames ({ORFs)}, both in the requirement of specific {tRNA} species and in the preference for amino acids encoded by e.g. A-rich codons. Nucleotide composition does obviously affect the secondary and tertiary structure of the {RNA} genome and its biological functions, but it does also influence phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences, and possibly the activity of the integrated {DNA} provirus. Over time, the nucleotide composition of the {HIV-1} genome is exceptionally conserved, varying by less than 1\% per base position per isolate within either group M, N, or O during 1983–2009. This extreme stability of the nucleotide composition may possibly be achieved by negative selection, perhaps conserving semi-stable {RNA} secondary structure as reverse transcription would be significantly affected for a less A-rich genome where secondary structures are expected to be more stable and thus more difficult to unfold.},

Our data provided direct evidence that the {HIV-1} A-rich pol sequence is not merely an evolutionary artifact of enzyme-induced hypermutations, and that {HIV-1} has adapted to rely on A-rich {RNA} sequences to support the synthesis of viral {cDNA} during reverse transcription, highlighting the utility of using ‘structurally poor’ {RNA} domains in regulating biological process.},

	abstract = {There is considerable {HIV-1} variation in patients. The extent of the variation is due to the high rate of viral replication, the high viral load, and the errors made during viral replication. Mutations can arise from errors made either by host {DNA-dependent} {RNA} polymerase {II} or by {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase ({RT)}, but the relative contributions of these two enzymes to the mutation rate are unknown. In addition, mutations in {RT} can affect its fidelity, but the effect of mutations in {RT} on the nature of the mutations that arise in vivo is poorly understood. We have developed an efficient system, based on existing technology, to analyze the mutations that arise in an {HIV-1} vector in a single cycle of replication. A {lacZα} reporter gene is used to identify viral {DNAs} that contain mutations which are analyzed by {DNA} sequencing. The forward mutation rate in this system is 1.4 × 10−5 mutations/bp/cycle, equivalent to the retroviral average. This rate is about 3-fold lower than previously reported for {HIV-1} in vivo and is much lower than what has been reported for purified {HIV-1} {RT} in vitro. Although the mutation rate was not affected by the orientation of {lacZα}, the sites favored for mutations (hot spots) in {lacZα} depended on which strand of {lacZα} was present in the viral {RNA.} The pattern of hot spots seen in {lacZα} in vivo did not match any of the published data obtained when purified {RT} was used to copy {lacZα} in vitro.},

abstract = {Drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of AIDS, due to the very high mutation rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and subsequent rapid development of resistance to new drugs. Identification of mutations associated with drug resistance is critical for both individualized treatment selection and new drug design. We have performed an automated mutation analysis of HIV Type 1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) from approximately 40,000 AIDS patient plasma samples sequenced by Specialty Laboratories Inc. from 1999 to mid-2002. This data set provides a nearly complete mutagenesis of HIV protease and enables the calculation of statistically significant K(a)/K(s) values for each individual amino acid mutation in protease and RT. Positive selection (i.e., a K(a)/K(s) ratio of >1, indicating increased reproductive fitness) detected 19 of 23 known drug-resistant mutation positions in protease and 20 of 34 such positions in RT. We also discovered 163 new amino acid mutations in HIV protease and RT that are strong candidates for drug resistance or fitness. Our results match available independent data on protease mutations associated with specific drug treatments and mutations with positive reproductive fitness, with high statistical significance (the P values for the observed matches to occur by random chance are 10(-5.2) and 10(-16.6), respectively). Our mutation analysis provides a valuable resource for AIDS research and will be available to academic researchers upon publication at http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/HIV. Our data indicate that positive selection mapping is an analysis that can yield powerful insights from high-throughput sequencing of rapidly mutating pathogens.},

title = {Evolution of human immunodeficiency virus under selection and weak recombination},
abstract = {To predict emergence of drug resistance in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, we study accumulation of preexisting beneficial alleles in a haploid population of N genomes. The factors included in the model are selection with the coefficient s and recombination with the small rate per genome r (r << s sqrt of k, where k is the average number of less-fit loci per genome). Mutation events are neglected. To describe evolution at a large number of linked loci, we generalize the analytic method we developed recently for an asexual population. We show that the distribution of genomes over the deleterious allele number moves in time as a "solitary wave" that is quasi-deterministic in the middle (on the average) but has stochastic edges. We arrive at a single-locus expression for the average accumulation rate, in which the effects of linkage, recombination, and random drift are all accounted for by the effective selection coefficient s lnNr/lnNs(2)k/r. At large N, the effective selection coefficient approaches the single-locus value s. Below the critical size N(c) approximately 1/r, a population eventually becomes a clone, recombination cannot produce new sequences, and virus evolution stops. Taking into account finite mutation rate predicts a small, finite rate of evolution at N < N(c). We verify the accuracy of the results analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation. On the basis of our findings, we predict that partial depletion of the HIV population by combined anti-retroviral therapy can suppress emergence of drug-resistant strains.},

	abstract = {It has long been assumed that {HIV-1} evolution is best described by deterministic evolutionary models because of the large population size. Recently, however, it was suggested that the effective population size (Ne) may be rather small, thereby allowing chance to influence evolution, a situation best described by a stochastic evolutionary model. To gain experimental evidence supporting one of the evolutionary models, we investigated whether the development of resistance to the protease inhibitor ritonavir affected the evolution of the env gene. Sequential serum samples from five patients treated with ritonavir were used for analysis of the protease gene and the V3 domain of the env gene. Multiple reverse {transcription–PCR} products were cloned, sequenced, and used to construct phylogenetic trees and to calculate the genetic variation and Ne. Genotypic resistance to ritonavir developed in all five patients, but each patient displayed a unique combination of mutations, indicating a stochastic element in the development of ritonavir resistance. Furthermore, development of resistance induced clear bottleneck effects in the env gene. The mean intrasample genetic variation, which ranged from 1.2\% to 5.7\% before treatment, decreased significantly (P {\textless} 0.025) during treatment. In agreement with these findings, Ne was estimated to be very small (500–15,000) compared with the total {HIV-1} {RNA} copy number. This study combines three independent observations, strong population bottlenecking, small Ne, and selection of different combinations of protease-resistance mutations, all of which indicate that {HIV-1} evolution is best described by a stochastic evolutionary model.},

As a result, an understanding of codon bias is central to fields as diverse as molecular evolution and biotechnology. Although recent advances in sequencing and synthetic biology have helped to resolve longstanding questions about codon bias, they have also uncovered striking patterns that suggest new hypotheses about protein synthesis. Ongoing work to quantify the dynamics of initiation and elongation is as important for understanding natural synonymous variation as it is for designing transgenes in applied contexts.},

Although it is clear that {HIV-1} and {HIV-2} originated in African primates, dating their transmission to humans is problematic, especially because of frequent recombination. Our ability to predict the spread of drug-resistance and immune-escape mutations depends on understanding how {HIV} evolution differs within and among hosts and on the role played by positive selection. For this purpose, extensive sampling of {HIV} genetic diversity is required, and is essential for informing the design of {HIV} vaccines.},
