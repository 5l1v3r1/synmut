We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful assessment. We have included a
brief discussion of the landscape aspect of HIV fitness and now cite
Ferguson et al, Immunity, 2013.

We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments, which have helped
us to improve the manuscript. We have resorted to a more sophisticated
sampling scheme for parameters in the computer simulations and now scan
a larger parameter space. All our conclusions remain valid, but are more
reliable now. We detail these improvements in our point to point
response below.

We agree that one generation in HIV takes closer to 2 days than 1
day. Most escape rates and selection coefficients, however, are more
readily measured in days and we have chosen to model HIV evolution with
generation of one day for simplicity. Factor of 2 changes in the
generation have next to now influence on the dynamics and only
renormalize genetic drift. Genetic drift is not a dominant force in HIV
evolution and the population size, the main determinant of drift, is not
known to this accuracy anyway. We have repeated a subset of the
simulations with a generation time of one day, finding now
difference. IS THIS SHOWN SOMEWHERE?

We have greatly extended the parameter space that we survey and now test
different values for the mutation rate, the recombination rate, the
generation time, the fitness effects, and the population size. To
accomodate this high dimensional data, we have changed figure 4. The
figure now shows the joint distribution of the deleterious effect and
the fraction of synonymous mutations that are deleterious that are
compatible with observations as a heat map. The marginal distribution of
the individual parameters consistent with the data are shown in the supplement.

The distribution of allowed deleterious is sharply peaked around
???. DISCUSS THE DIVERSITY ISSUES.

We have added a discussion of the parameter ranges to the methods
section.

Indeed. Our previous simulations where not limited by coverage of the
parameter space. Now that we cover a much larger (higher dimensional)
space, we did implement a Latin hypercube sampling scheme. We thank the
reviewer for this very useful suggestion. WE MIGHT WANT TO SHOW THE RANK
CORRELATION MATRIX BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT VARIABLES.

We agree with reviewer that HIV evolution is bursty, but we would like
to mention that actual number of cells that get infected every day is
around 10^7 and hence much larger than we are able to simulate. The
population size in our simulation can therefore be viewed as an
effective population size. We have investigated the sensitivity of our
results to changes in the population size and find that our conclusions
are insensitive to the population size as long as the product of
population size and mutation rate is not very much smaller than 1.  

WE SHOULD ADD A DISCUSSION AND POINT OUT HERE.

Yes, much of the stochastic component in the dynamics of the frequencies
of synonymous mutations will be due to draft. The directed component can
be attributed to selection. WE ADDED A DISCUSSION OF THIS ISSUE.

We agree with the reviewer that the both hypothesis we put forward to
explain the fixation pattern of non-synonymous mutations are somewhat
tentative. Qualitatively, however, the processes we discuss have been
observed and we do cite experimental evidence. NEED TO ELABORATE.
